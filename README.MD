## Add translate

* Install environment first(python pip packages in the requirments.txt)
```shell
apt install python3 pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* If you need to add a new lanuage, or skip

Add locale in [i18n.py](./COMTool/i18n.py)
```
locales=["en", "zh_CN", "zh_TW", "ja"]
```
append your language to this list, locales can be found [here](https://www.science.co.il/language/Locale-codes.php) or [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation), `zh_CN` for example means China Mainland, corresponding luanguage is simplified Chinese characters, `zh_TW` means China Taiwan, and language is traditional Chinese characters, you can also only use `zh` to use simplified Chinese characters.

* Generate translate files

```shell
python i18n.py prepare
```

This command will generate `.po` files in locales folder

* Translate mannually

Then translate `.po` files, this is a standard translate file format which named `gettext`

* Generate binary translate files

to make it read faster, the text files `.po` should be convert to binary file `.mo`, just run command:
```shell
python i18n.py finish
```
and then you can see `locales/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo` file

* Test

Run application, you will see the new translation
